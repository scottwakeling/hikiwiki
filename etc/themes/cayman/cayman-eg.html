Why Functional Programming?
</h3>




<p>My first encounter with LISP was while reading <em>Hackers</em> by Steven Levy while I was at college. If Gosper, Greenblatt, and Stallman thought LISP was something special, I reasoned, who was I to argue? I resolved to learn it one day, and spent the next fifteen years learning everything but..</p>
<p>Years later I read Tim Sweeney's presentation on what languages of the future might look like if we're ever to cope with (and make use of) 32+ cores. Haskell looked quite scary to me then, and still does today, although I have at last started writing my own basic programs in it now.</p>
<p>Then John Carmack started talking about Scheme and Haskell, and the benefits of writing pure code - zero side-effects, no mutable state, code running in any order and thus immediately parallelizable..</p>
<p>It's around this time I did some early exercises from <em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em>. I remember it was very hard going, it was so alien to my imperative trained mind that not even the chance to finally learn (a) LISP was enough to keep me at it.</p>
<p>Time passed. I thought about it from time to time and read around the edges of the subject. Imperative languages of the day were providing lambda expressions and functional programming was having a sort of renaissance (it came first, after all, as far as higher level languages go), so I read around some more and became more interested..</p>
<h3>Mutable State</h3>
<p>Functional Programming isn't just lambda expressions and functions as objects.</p>
<p>Mutable state and side-effects are not scalable across many-cores, and since I'm nowhere near ready to resign myself to working in a way that I know is on the way out, I am learning Scheme and Haskell.</p>
<p>I'm also tired of mutable state. And side-effects. And writing and maintaining tests that check only one ordered sequence of steps and inputs. And caring what order my code runs in. And worrying about that combination of data and steps I might not have considered in the code I wrote today..</p>
