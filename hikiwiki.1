hikiwiki \- a tiny wiki compiler

.B hikiwiki
[\fB\-r, \-\-remove] repo

.B hikiwiki
[\fB\-\-rebuild] repo output

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hikiwiki
helps you build a simple wiki or blog with markdown and git.
.PP
This is probably not the wiki compiler you are looking for. I wrote it as a
learning exercise in Haskell, so it misses many, many features you will need
in RL. Take a look at ikiwiki, it is far more mature and useful.

.SH OPTIONS
.nf
\-\-init
      Prompts for a wiki name and owner. Creates a new bare shared repo
      based on the contents of etc/setup/auto-blog, clones it to make the
      source directory, and makes an initial commit. Also creates a YAML
      formatted configuration file.

      public_html is created if not already present. The wiki's default
      desination directory is created in here. An initial HTML version of
      the new repo will be found inside. You can point your web server
      here immediately to see your new site.

\-\-remove wiki
      Deletes the base repo, config file, and source directory for the
      specified wiki. Leaves any build output in public_html in place.

\-\-rebuild wiki
      Rebuilds the named wiki source directory into the configured
      destination directory.
