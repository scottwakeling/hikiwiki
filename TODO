no error message at all if pandoc not installed!

--init should end with a rebuild, ready to go..

Wrap in a cabal package? Is that a build system aswell?
	- depends: regex-posix, MissingH
	- install HikiWiki (post-update can then HikiWiki, not ./HikiWiki, and
		won't need hacky etc folder laying around, /etc/.hikiwiki)

Learn and apply some basic Haddock doc

I like :reload in ghci to see if it's compiling
  but running a simple test suite as part of make.sh would be even better!



Improve the command line parsing (RWH late chapter)

hikiwiki --rebuild repo
  loads config from repo.setup and compile srcdir into dstdir

staging area
  updating website/wiki/blog with git is great, but some projects might
    require a staging area because pushing straight to 'production' is scary!

templating (heist?)

what does git fetch do!?

what do the git config merge/branch lines in Joey's makerepo shell do?

Manual Test

ssh to remote server
HikiWiki --init
repo1
back to localhost
git clone repo1 from remote server
make changes and push
remote server needs to:
  run post-update
  cd into src folder
  git pull
  --rebuild repo1
