srcdir and destdir need to be absolute paths in config yaml

no error message at all if pandoc not installed!

--init should end with a rebuild, ready to go..

- install HikiWiki as part of build
  (post-update can then HikiWiki, not ./HikiWiki, and
   won't need hacky etc folder laying around, it can go in ~/.hikiwiki/etc)

Going to have:
  ~/.hikiwiki/wikilist|etc|themese|plugins
Not going to have /etc/.hikiwiki until you explicitly handle sudo invocation

Learn and apply some basic Haddock doc

I like :reload in ghci to see if it's compiling
  but running a simple test suite as part of make.sh would be even better!

Improve the command line parsing (RWH late chapter)

hikiwiki --rebuild repo
  loads config from repo.setup and compile srcdir into dstdir
  if wiki not registered, rebuild that local src dir if present (staging/test)

staging area
  updating website/wiki/blog with git is great, but some projects might
    require a staging area because pushing straight to 'production' is scary!
  So, if --rebuild srcDir is not enough, you need to be able to clone your
    production wiki out and use --init to create a new remote and dst dir in
    place for a staging area people can clone from and push to..

templating (heist?)

plugins

hikiwiki theme install foo
hikiwiki plugin install bar
