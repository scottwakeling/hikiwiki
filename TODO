Learn and apply some basic Haddock doc

I like :reload in ghci to see if it's compiling
  but running a simple test suite as part of make.sh would be even better!

install HikiWiki as part of make.sh (post-update then HikiWiki, not ./HikiWiki)

Improve the command line parsing (RWH late chapter)

post-update
  runs when changes come in (active branch setting in .setup?)
  cd into src dir and pull
  hikiwiki --rebuild repo (looks at .setup to get srcdir, dstdir etc. ?)

hikiwiki --rebuild repo
  loads config from repo.setup and compile srcdir into dstdir

staging area
  updating website/wiki/blog with git is great, but some projects might
    require a staging area because pushing straight to 'production' is scary!

templating (heist?)

what does git fetch do!?

what do the git config merge/branch lines in Joey's makerepo shell do?
