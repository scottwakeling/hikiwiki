srcdir and destdir need to be absolute paths in config yaml

init
  can be used to create a base repo, dest dir and wikilist entry for content
    in an existing src dir (i.e. a clone from another remote, for example)
  this mode prompts you for what the new 'remote' should be called, if
    hikiwiki sees existing remotes already against the seeding src dir

no error message at all if pandoc not installed!

--init should end with a rebuild, ready to go..

- install HikiWiki as part of build
  (post-update can then HikiWiki, not ./HikiWiki, and
   won't need hacky etc folder laying around, ~/.hikiwiki/etc)

Learn and apply some basic Haddock doc

I like :reload in ghci to see if it's compiling
  but running a simple test suite as part of make.sh would be even better!

Improve the command line parsing (RWH late chapter)

hikiwiki --rebuild repo
  loads config from repo.setup and compile srcdir into dstdir

staging area
  updating website/wiki/blog with git is great, but some projects might
    require a staging area because pushing straight to 'production' is scary!

templating (heist?)

what does git fetch do!?

what do the git config merge/branch lines in Joey's makerepo shell do?
