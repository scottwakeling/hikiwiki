post-update
  runs when changes come in (active branch setting in .setup?)
  cd into src dir and pull
  hikiwiki --rebuild repo (looks at .setup to get srcdir, dstdir etc.)

hikiwiki --rebuild repo
  loads config from repo.setup and compile srcdir into dstdir

    require a staging area because pushing straight to 'production' is scary!

templating (heist?)

what does git fetch do!?

what do the git config merge/branch lines in Joey's makerepo shell do?
